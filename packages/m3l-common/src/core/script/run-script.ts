/**
 * Runs `script` through {@link M3LScript.run}, wrapping it with the
 * process-level composition-root behavior every automation script and Lambda
 * handler needs: installing the process guards, forcing the second-signal
 * exit code to {@link M3L_EXIT_CODES.INTERRUPTED} for the duration of the
 * run, best-effort persisting an end-of-run `M3LRunReport`, and mapping any
 * failure to a `process.exitCode` — all without ever re-throwing or calling
 * `process.exit()` itself.
 *
 * On failure, the error is routed to `script.logger.errorFrom` (which never
 * throws) and then absorbed — deliberately **not** re-thrown. Re-throwing
 * here would let the rejection escape as an unhandled promise rejection, and
 * Node then prints the raw stack and exits with code `1` regardless of
 * whatever `process.exitCode` this function already set, defeating the whole
 * point of the exit-code registry this phase exists to deliver. The error is
 * not lost: it is logged via `errorFrom` and (best-effort) embedded in the
 * persisted failure report.
 *
 * The forced second-signal exit code ({@link M3L_EXIT_CODES.INTERRUPTED}) is
 * scoped to the duration of this call via
 * `internal/script/signalHandlers`'s depth-aware
 * `pushForcedSignalExitCode`/release pair, not a plain capture-then-restore:
 * the baseline is captured only on the OUTERMOST in-flight `runScript` call
 * and restored only once every overlapping/nested `runScript` call in the
 * same process has released. This composes correctly for nested calls (a
 * `runScript` invoked from inside another's `mainFn`) and for genuinely
 * overlapping calls (two `runScript(...)` promises in flight at once,
 * `await`ed via `Promise.all` or otherwise un-awaited) — in both cases the
 * override observed by a shutdown handler always reflects the innermost
 * still-running call, and the pre-existing value is restored exactly once,
 * when the last of them settles. A bare `M3LScript.run()` elsewhere in the
 * same process, entirely outside any `runScript` call, is never affected by
 * an override that outlived its run.
 *
 * @param script - The configured `M3LScript` to run.
 * @param mainFn - The user function to run at stage 7 of the pipeline.
 * @param options - Optional `dryRun`/`report`/`trail` overrides.
 * @returns A promise that always resolves, never rejects.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { M3LScript, runScript } from "@m3l-automation/m3l-common/core";
 * import { M3LError } from "@m3l-automation/m3l-common/core";
 *
 * const script = new M3LScript({
 *   metadata: { name: "import-users", version: "1.0.0" },
 * });
 *
 * await runScript(script, async () => {
 *   const shouldFail = false;
 *   if (shouldFail) {
 *     throw new M3LError("import failed", { code: "ERR_CONFIG_MISSING" });
 *   }
 * });
 * // process.exitCode is now set on failure; runScript itself never throws.
